          An adventure is an exciting experience or undertaking that is
          typically bold, sometimes risky. Adventures may be activities with
          danger such as traveling, exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing,
          scuba diving, river rafting, or other extreme sports.
          <br />
          <br />
          Adventures are often undertaken to create psychological arousal or in
          order to achieve a greater goal, such as the pursuit of knowledge that
          can only be obtained by such activities. Adventurous experiences
          create psychological arousal,which can be interpreted as negative
          (e.g. fear) or positive (e.g. flow).

         <p class="text">
          Bicycle touring is the taking of self-contained cycling trips for pleasure, adventure or autonomy rather than sport, commuting or exercise. Bicycle touring can range from single-day trips to extended travels spanning weeks or months. Tours may be planned by the participant or organized by a tourism business, local club or organization, or a charity as a fund-raising venture.
          <br />
          <br />
          Cycle touring beyond the range of a day trip may need a bike capable of carrying heavy loads. Although many different bicycles can be used, specialist touring bikes are built to carry appropriate loads and to be ridden more comfortably over long distances.

         </div>

         <p class="text">
          Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure.[1] The pilot sits in a harness or in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing. Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the outside.
          <br />
          <br />
          Paraglider flights can last many hours and cover many hundreds of kilometres, though flights of one to five hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm.

         </div>

         <p class="text">
          Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave pools.
          <br />
          <br />
          The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance. There are several types of boards. The Moche of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft.
